im in 11th grade and applying to colleges is a huge headache - finding schools, calculating chances, writing applications... so i decided to make a simple AI that helps with this stuff.
i started this a few months ago but the code was trash so i didnt upload it. its still not great but whatever, i need something for my portfolio to look better for college apps.
its a console script that asks about your major, gpa, portfolio and recommends some unis from my list. chances are calculated with simple ML but the data is fake so dont take it seriously lol
